# **React Blog App** <!-- omit in toc -->

A repository to practice React, React-Hooks, React-Router, and React-Bootstrap.
This repository serves as the front end of our two part react-blog-app.
The API routes for the app have been created in another repository named [full-stack-react-blog](https://github.com/plooney81/full-stack-react-blog).

<!-- ## **How it works**
 -->

## **Requirements**
The Requirements for this exercise were as follows: 
* Using our API routes on the backend, to create a blogging application that allows users to comment on posts as well as create new articles.


## **What I Learned**
* Setting up Cors in express in order to allow the front end and back end to communicate while running each server on a different port.


## **Still Todo**
1. Continue rendering the homepage.
2. Set up the routes for inspecting a particular article/post ( will have a comments section for users to read all comments/add a new comment)
3. Set up the new post page so users can add a new article/post
4. General beautification
